##### Branch Naming template
For branches to be created the template should be as follows
```
branchType/boardInitals-ticketId-name-of-the-story
```
Branch type options:
- feat -> feature
- bug -> bug
- doc -> documentation
Example:
```
feat/ME-876-showing-branch-naming-conventions
```
When creating the branch let JIRA create the base branch and just add on the type of branch you are doing, here is a tutorial
