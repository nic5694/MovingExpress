##### Branch Naming template
For branches to be created the template should be as follows
```
branchType/boardInitals-ticketId-name-of-the-story
```
Branch type options:
- feat -> feature
- bug -> bug
- doc -> documentation
Example:
```
feat/ME-876-showing-branch-naming-conventions
```
When creating the branch let JIRA create the base branch and just add on the type of branch you are doing, here is a tutorial

Once clicked you will see the following

CLick the clipboard button and paste it in your terminal or gitbash and add on the branch tag -> meaning the type of branch feat or bug
#### Pull Request Commit Naming
This is pretty much the exact same as the Pull Request Naming except that at the end there will be an auto-generated number in parentheses. Please don't delete it. Simply add your stuff before it.
```
//put whatever type of branch you were on if it was a bug put bug if it was a feature put feat like explained above
feat(ME-JiraID): short description (#420)
```
